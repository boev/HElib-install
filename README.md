# HElib-install
HElib HAS BEEN REWORKED AND USES CMAKE. IT CAN AND SHOULD BE INSTALLED AS SHARED LIBRARY. IT ALSO NO LONGER REQUIRES ARMADILLO FOR FFT.

PLEASE USE THE OFFICIAL INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR HELIB.

Deprecated:
Compilation and installation example for HElib aimed at helping new users.  

Use:  
1. make install-armadillo  
2. make install-gmp  
3. make install-ntl  
4. make install-helib  

The C++ boost installation make install-boost is left just as optinal addition if you need it.  
Mind that clean assumes standard lib installation folder and is only testen on Ubuntu.
